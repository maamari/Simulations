check H0 quasars - check for systematic errors
direct simulation monte carlo

-When hubble rate = momentum transfer rate interactions stop
-Modes enter horizon at different times
-Smaller subject to scattering time soon
-Larger enter later
-Horizon getting bigger so larger fourier modes=smaller k enters sphere of influence because they become smaller than horizon size
-If you are a mode that entered before decoupling, you feel consequence of interactions happening
-Want to predict for a given cross-section where the cutoff will be, aka mapping between sigma0 and k
-From limit on kcutoff, I can map sigma0
-Get that by saying when mom trans=hubble, moment of decoupling, mom trans func of sigma0, and hubble is func of redshift, so can compute critical redshift by equating the two for fixed sigma0, every cross-section has different redshift of decoupling, interacting more weakly decouple sooner
-sovle for z and then size for horizon size corresponding to z
-from calculating physical size of horizon, figure which fourier mode corresponds to
-get the fourier mode that was the last to enter when decoupling happened
-so then you map k to Mmin
-Take mean density with radius of lambda_crit and say that this gives Mcrit

talk about background, if you have any opportunities for internships I'd really appreciate if you could check out my resume

Before my time in physics, I was a jazz saxophonist. Although these disciplines may intuitively seem starkly contrasting, both have taught me a great deal about innovation which I believe would translate well to the cutting-edge work being done at HRL. First is a respect for fundamentals — just as a soloist must understand the underlying chord progressions before improvising atop, a physicist must study the laws of nature before attempting to further uncover the details of our universe. Then comes the pushing of boundaries through calculated risks — in jazz known as tension and release, in physics as probing hypotheses to wits' end. Finally, and most importantly, is the need for fluid collaboration — the ability to listen and learn from others is imperative in constructing coherent works, be it in music or research.

My work in computational astrophysics has not only further cultivated my aforementioned commitment to innovation, but also sprouted a deep interest in technology and programming. HRL's desire to operate on the cutting-edge by employing breakthroughs in technology aligns directly with my past experiences reading, comprehending, and building upon innovative research, and I am confident that the things I have learned over the past several years would not only translate well to the technical sector, but have also served to set a sturdy foundation for new learning and growth.

I am a fast learner and am certain that I can effectively and efficiently learn any skills or knowledge that I may presently lack. I started playing the saxophone in 8th grade and by the 10th grade I was the top saxophonist in the state, by 12th grade the third best in the nation. I started research in physics during the summer of my sophomore year and to date have several publications, one soon to come which will significantly impact the quest for understanding dark matter. The prospect of learning something new is what drives me and I wish nothing more than to be able to gain valuable experience and new insights from the talented individuals at Anduril. 

I've attached my resume below, I'd really appreciate if you have the time to check it out and let me know if I might be a fit for any available positions or internships — I believe the SLAM Engineer and Numerical/Scientific Computing positions agree with my interests and experience very well, but I'm open to whatever position I can best contribute to and learn from.

Thanks so much for your time. Hope you're doing well in the midst of this craziness.

Best regards,
Karime Maamari
